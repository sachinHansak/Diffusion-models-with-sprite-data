# Diffusion-models-with-sprite-data
Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) &amp; Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIMs) are powerful generative models which are used for high quality and diverse image generation. The key difference between them is sampling efficiency. DDIMs are designed to accelerate this process, making them more efficient in terms of sampling speed.
